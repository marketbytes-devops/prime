<h4 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Calibration Service General Terms and Conditions</h4>

<p><strong>Comprehensive Calibration Reports:</strong> Following the calibration of each instrument, a comprehensive calibration report will be generated. Prime Innovation adheres to the fundamental principle governing the utilization of its accreditation logo. The accreditation logo serves as an assurance to the market that Prime Innovation complies with the applicable accreditation requirements. It is essential to note that the accreditation logo and the company logo of Prime Innovation are exclusively reserved for the sole use of Prime Innovation. Customers are expressly prohibited from utilizing these logos for profit, such as in advertisements on documents or commercial papers.</p>

<p><strong>Tolerance Limits:</strong> Customers are required to communicate their tolerance limits to Prime Innovation through email, facilitated by the assigned Prime Innovation Sales representative. In instances where no tolerance limit is communicated to Prime Innovation, the manufacturer’s tolerance limit will be implemented. In cases where customers fail to provide the tolerance limit before calibration and subsequently wish to re-calibrate with their specified tolerance, Prime Innovation will apply the same amount as originally quoted.</p>

<p><strong>Defective Units:</strong> If a unit is identified as defective and requires repair, such matters fall outside the scope of Prime Innovation's services. In such cases, you will be advised to reach out to the manufacturer or your respective vendor for necessary repairs. Following the completion of repairs, you are then encouraged to resubmit the unit to Prime Innovation for calibration.</p>

<p><strong>Calibration Methods:</strong> Prime Innovation is committed to employing calibration methods that are suitable for the specific calibration tasks undertaken. Whenever feasible, Prime Innovation will utilize methods outlined in the instrument's service manual. Alternatively, international, regional, or national standards will be referenced when appropriate. In some cases, Prime Innovation may also employ methods developed in-house. The method used for calibration will be clearly indicated on the test report. Nonstandard methods will only be employed with your explicit agreement.</p>
